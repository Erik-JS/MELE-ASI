## About this repository

This repository is a collection of various plugins (DLL files renamed to *.asi) which provide new features and functionalities to the game. The biggest advantage of ASI plugins is that it's easy for users to choose which features they want, and enable/disable them at any time. Anyone can make and distribute their own plugin.

**An ASI Plugin requires the use of a separate ASI Loader in order to be used.**

**Intended for use with proxy DLL available at https://github.com/Erik-JS/proxy-dll-64**

-----------------------------------------------------------

**How to use a plugin:** simply drop MELExxx.asi in the game's root folder, or an 'ASI' folder in the game's root folder. You're not limited in how many plugins you can use at a time.

**Disabling a plugin:** delete the respective .asi file. Alternatively, you can instead move it to another folder, or rename it so it doesn't end with ".asi" (or, if you're using 'ASI' folder, rename it to disable all plugins).

-----------------------------------------------------------

**Plugin compatibility:**
- MELExxx: can be used with any game from Mass Effect: Legendary Edition.
- ME1LExxx: can only be used with Mass Effect 1 from ME:LE.
